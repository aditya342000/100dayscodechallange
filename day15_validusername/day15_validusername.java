HackerRank Java Valid Username Regular Expression - Problem Statement
You are updating the username policy on your company's internal networking platform. According to the policy, a username is considered valid if all the following constraints are satisfied:

The username consists of 8 to 30 characters inclusive. If the username consists of less than 8 or greater than 30 characters, then it is an invalid username.
The username can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). Alphanumeric characters describe the character set consisting of lowercase characters [a-z], uppercase characters [A-Z], and digits [0-9].
The first character of the username must be an alphabetic character, i.e., either lowercase character [A-Z] or uppercase character [A-Z].
